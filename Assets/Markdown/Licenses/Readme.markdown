# Licenses

_Markdown Support_ relies on two existing code libraries, and one font.

The font is _Roboto_, and is licensed under Apache 2.0. 
- [Roboto License](ROBOTO_LICENSE.txt)

There are two code libraries...

- [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) is under BSD-2 license, https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/license.txt, and the license file is included locally, [here](MARKDIG_LICENSE.txt)
- [Highlight](https://github.com/thomasjo/highlight/tree/master) is under MIT license, https://github.com/thomasjo/highlight/blob/master/LICENSE.md . I made a private fork of the project and built my own `.dll`. 

Without these excellent libraries, _Markdown Support_ would not be possible in Unity.
